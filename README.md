Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🛳️

📝 Project Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using the Titanic dataset. The dataset includes information about passengers, their demographics, ticket class, and survival status. The goal of this project was to uncover patterns, insights, and relationships within the data using Python.

📋 Key Highlights
	•	Performed data loading, inspection, and cleaning.
	•	Identified and handled missing data effectively.
	•	Created new features like Age_Group based on logical conditions.
	•	Visualized data distributions and class-based groupings.
	•	Generated actionable insights for further analysis.

 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
	•	Python: Programming language for analysis and scripting.
	•	Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
	•	Matplotlib: Data visualization.
	•	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for writing and running code.

 📂 Files in Repository
	•	Titanic_EDA.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA process.
	•	titanic.csv: The Titanic dataset used in this project (ensure it’s downloaded to run the notebook).

 🔍 Steps Performed
	1.	Dataset Loading:
	•	Loaded the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
	•	Displayed the structure, shape, and initial rows for an overview.
	2.	Data Cleaning:
	•	Identified missing values and calculated their counts.
	•	Dropped unnecessary columns and imputed missing data as needed.
	3.	Feature Engineering:
	•	Created a new column Age_Group to classify passengers into:
	•	Child: Age < 18
	•	Adult: 18 ≤ Age < 60
	•	Senior: Age ≥ 60
	4.	Data Visualization:
	•	Visualized the distribution of passengers by class and age group.
	•	Explored survival rates across different groups.
	5.	Insights Generation:
	•	Examined correlations and group-level statistics for key variables.

 📊 Sample Insights
	•	Most passengers were adults, followed by children, with fewer seniors.
	•	The average fare varied significantly by ticket class.
	•	Missing values in the Age column required careful handling for meaningful analysis.

 📥 Dataset Source

The Titanic dataset can be downloaded from the following sources:
	•	Kaggle - Titanic Dataset
	•	GitHub - Titanic Dataset

 🚀 Next Steps
	•	Apply machine learning models to predict survival.
	•	Perform advanced data visualizations using Seaborn.
	•	Explore additional feature engineering techniques.
